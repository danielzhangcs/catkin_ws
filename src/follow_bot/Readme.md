# Double follow with tf2
author -- Daniel Zhang (danielzhang@brandeis.edu)

## Project Introduction
This project is about to use image data got from camera to detect and follow the line on the ground.

Specifically, image data generated by camera will be published to camera/rgb/image_raw. then the code will firstly transform the image data to the format OpenCv use. and use OpenCv to process the image data to HSV since we already know the color of line is yellow. then we could set threshold to filter yellow data from the image data. after that, we will calculate the centroid of the yellow line in front of the robot and tune velocity to follow it.

and the robot will infinitely follow the line beacuse if there no more yellow line or an obstacles is in front the robot, it will turn back and keep following the line.


## How to start
In order to use this project, we just need to run the launch file to start the word and then run the line_follower script.
* catkin_make
* source devel/setup.bash
* roslaunch follow_bot linemission.launch
* roslaunch follow_bot line_follower.py
